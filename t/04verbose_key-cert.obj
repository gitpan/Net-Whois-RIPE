The key-cert object:

The key certificate object is used to store PGP
certificates for use with the maintainer objects
as a means of authentication.

The content of the attributes of the key-cert object are defined below:

key-cert
	A string identifying a cryptographic key used for
	authentication (eg. PGPKEY-2384AF30)

	PGPKEY-<string>, where string is an 8 character hexadecimal
	number identifying the key contained in the object without
	leading "0x" hexadecimal symbol.

method
	Describes the cryptographic method used to sign messages
	(currently only PGP)
	<string>, where string is the name of the method. This
	field is generated by the database itself.

	

owner
	The user ids associated with a cryptographic key.

	E-mail addresses. This fields are generated by the Database.

fingerpr
	The fingerprint associated with a cryptographic key

	A string. This field is generated by the Database.

certif
	A cryptographic key certificate.

	Strings of hex encode bytes representing a key certificate.

remarks
	General remarks. Can include an URL or RFC822
	address (if preceeded by mailto:).

	<free text>

notify
	The e-mail address to which notifications of changes to
